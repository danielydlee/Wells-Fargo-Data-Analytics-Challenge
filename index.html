<p>Dialogues on social media nowadays can provide tremendous insight into the behaviours, desires, pains, and thoughts of consumers. This project that our group worked on developed a repeatable process that identifies, classifies, and extracts the underlying drivers of consumer financial conversations and comments in social media data.</p>

<a id="approach-and-methodology" class="anchor" href="#approach-and-methodology" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Approach and Methodology</h3>

<p>Our team was given the data set from August 2015, and Facebook comments between Aug. 2014 and Aug. 2015 regarding the chosen banks across the industry from the data file given, and first analyzed its vocabulary frequency, 3,000 counts being the least amount of frequency. This process helped us to understand the general comments that were being said about the bank industry, including the ones involving four main banks. We also approached these tweets and Facebook comments by excerpting those which only involve our four main banks. We first split the tweets and comments by Bank A, B, C, D, trying to grasp the level of negativeness and positiveness of each bank by using the sentiment scoring algorithm which would provide a score for each tweets and comments between -10 and 10 with 0 being neutral. The tweets and Facebook comments that were split at the previous stage contained all different kinds of topics that were not financially related. Therefore, we now wanted to pick out tweets and comments that only take financial terms into account among them to comprehend how positively or negatively each bank was perceived by customers. We then used the same sentiment scoring algorithm method again on those financial related tweets and comments to score each bank according to the score on each tweets and comments.</p>

<p>According to the data we have gathered from our approach and methodology, we could find several relationships between frequently used vocabulary and social conversation topics. Frequently used words such as “account”, “credit”, “finance”, “service” which will be thoroughly analyzed in the later stage of this report are great financially related indication of how the public perceives the bank industry or their specific bank on daily basis. The unconventional term like “GetCollegeReady”  that appears more than 3,000 times is also a great case of how these tweets and Facebook comments convey the social topic at the time. “GetCollegeReady” was one of four main banks’ subsidiary website with a purpose to better educate and engage students, parents, families, and high school counselors on best practices for planning and preparing for college. The site helps students understand how to pay for college, manage money, and build credit while in college taking into account a person’s full financial picture, including student loans, college credit cards, student checking and savings accounts, and student insurance. In an effort to amplify Get College Ready, the company leveraged a variety of its own social media channels and collaborate with nonprofit organizations using the hashtag #GetCollegeReady, which better explains why this term appeared on our dataset very frequently.  </p>
